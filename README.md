## What is SkillsGate?

SkillsGate lets you browse, install, and manage AI agent skills from a single interface. It works with 18+ agents and gives you access to a catalog of 91,000+ skills.

Instead of hunting through GitHub repos and copying markdown files by hand, you open SkillsGate, search for what you need, and install it to any combination of agents with one click.

Available as a **desktop app** (macOS, Windows, Linux) and a **terminal UI** for keyboard-driven workflows.
