## Why SkillsGate?

AI coding skills are scattered across hundreds of GitHub repos. You can't find what exists, creators get no visibility, and every team builds the same workflows from scratch.

SkillsGate fixes this. One search, one install command, every agent.

---

## Managing Skills

SkillsGate gives you three ways to manage your AI agent skills, depending on how you prefer to work.

### Desktop App

The desktop app provides a visual, Finder-style experience:

- **Browse installed skills** in a three-column layout with agent filtering on the left, skill list in the middle, and rendered SKILL.md content on the right
- **View and edit** -- toggle between the rendered view and a raw editor to modify SKILL.md content directly. Changes are saved to disk instantly
- **Per-agent management** -- remove a skill from a specific agent (e.g., uninstall from Cursor but keep in Claude Code) or remove from all agents at once
- **Open in Finder** -- click the folder icon to jump to the skill's directory on disk
- **Discover and install** -- browse the catalog of 80,000+ skills, search with keywords or AI-powered semantic search, and install with one click
- **Favorites** -- star skills from the catalog for quick access later
- **Remote servers** -- connect to other machines via SSH to browse and sync skills
- **Settings sync** -- preferences are shared with the TUI via a local SQLite database

### Terminal UI (TUI)

For keyboard-driven workflows:

- **Three-panel layout** -- agent filter sidebar, skill list, and inline detail panel
- **Navigate with keyboard** -- `j/k` to move, `v` to view detail, `e` to see raw source, `o` to open folder
- **Per-agent delete** -- press `d` on a multi-agent skill and choose which agent to remove from
- **Discover tab** -- search the catalog, toggle between keyword (`[Keyword]`) and AI search (`[AI Search]`) with `m`
- **Favorites tab** -- view and manage your starred skills
- **Servers tab** -- add SSH servers, sync remote skills, browse cached results
- **Settings** -- press `s` to configure install scope, method, theme, and more

### CLI

For scripting and automation:

```bash
# Install from multiple sources
skillsgate add @username/my-skill               # from SkillsGate registry
skillsgate add vercel-labs/agent-skills          # from GitHub
skillsgate add owner/repo@specific-skill         # specific skill in a repo
skillsgate add ./my-local-skills                 # from a local path

# Manage installed skills
skillsgate list                                  # show all installed skills
skillsgate list -g                               # show global skills
skillsgate remove my-skill                       # remove a skill
skillsgate update                                # update all skills
skillsgate sync                                  # sync skills from node_modules

# Search and discover
skillsgate search "tailwind responsive"          # AI-powered semantic search
skillsgate scan @username/some-skill             # security scan before installing

# Publish your own
skillsgate publish --init                        # create a SKILL.md template
skillsgate publish ./my-skill                    # publish to SkillsGate

# Launch the TUI from the CLI
skillsgate tui
```
